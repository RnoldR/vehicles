# GA - Simple Genetic algorithm

GA was developed to compute hyperparameters for machine-learning algorithms. It codes integer and floating point variables, arrays and lists on a bitstring. This bitstring is subjected to mutations and cross-overs to generate children with different characteristics. There is a fitness function that determines how fit a ga is. 

The population consists of one or more ga's. a next generation is computed by generating new children. New children are generated by different methods like elite, randomization and roulette wheel. The general principle is that more fit individuals have a higher rate on multiplication and selection. 

The fitness function is written by the developer. 

## Kick-off - using GA's for linear regression

Linear regression is the simplest form of machine learning.
